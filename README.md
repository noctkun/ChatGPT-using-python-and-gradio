My take on DIY ChatGPT using OpenAI API.

## Steps to Follow 😁
  
  * Open VS Code (or any other IDE).
  
  * Have the ```index.py``` code there.
  
  * Install the library dependancies in terminal as given:
   ```pip install openai```
   ```pip install gradio```      
  
  * Get your API keys from https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys.
  
  * Paste the keys in as a string in  *line 9*.
  
  * Finally, simply run ```python index.py``` in the terminal and TADAAA!

NOTE: 
The environment runs locally by default, To create a public link, set `share=True` in `launch()` in *line 55*.
The interactions between ChatGPT is limited (defined as credit by OpenAI), if you want to interact more with the AI then you might need subscription.    

Hope You Enjoyed It!

Peace ✌🏻
